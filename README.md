## Login Command

This set of commands allows you to manage user authentication and login state.

- `.register`: Create a new account.
- `.login`: Log in to your account.
- `.state`: Show the current login state.
- `.logout`: Log out from your account.

Your user data is securely stored locally at `source/users.txt` and **will not** be sent to any external servers.

## System Command

Use these commands to interact with system-related operations. Please note that all of the following actions are simulated and **do not affect your actual system**.

- `.help`: Get information about available commands.
- `.test`: Check system processes, files, or encryption.
- `.render`: Open and render a 3D model to assess performance.
- `.exit`: Safely exit the terminal program.

## Internet Command

Interact with online services using these commands.

- `.connect`: Connect to a server to access various services.
- `.connect_state`: Check the connection status.
  
**Please keep in mind:**

- **Real Connection Check**: The `.connect` command checks your internet connection using the Python `socket` library, without sending actual data.

- **Connection State**: The `.connect_state` command informs you of your connection status based on your terminal interactions.

- **Educational Use**: These commands are for learning and demonstration purposes, not actual internet access or activities.

## PPM (Python Package Manager) Command

Manage Python packages using the PPM command. Please note that this command is for demonstration purposes and **does not perform actual installations**.

- `ppm`: Open the PPM function.

    The PPM (Python Package Manager) command provides a simple way to **simulatedly** manage Python packages within this terminal clone. You can use this command to install, update, or remove packages for your projects. Please keep in mind that the installations are not real and only serve as examples.

    After running the PPM command, you might notice the creation of a `__pycache__` directory. This directory stores compiled Python bytecode files and is automatically generated by Python for performance optimization. It is safe to delete the `__pycache__` directory if you no longer need it. Deleting it will not have any impact on the functionality of this terminal clone or your projects. The directory will be regenerated as needed.

- `ppm --list`: List installed packages on this PC.

    Use this command to view a list of Python packages currently installed on your PC.

Please feel free to manage your Python packages using the PPM command, knowing that the package installations are not actual and that deleting the `__pycache__` directory won't affect the functionality of this terminal clone or your projects.

## Recommended Python Version

We strongly recommend using Python version 3.10.xx for the best experience with this project. While efforts are made to ensure compatibility with other versions, Python 3.10.xx offers optimal performance and compatibility with the features of this project.

Python 3.10.xx introduces numerous enhancements, optimizations, and new features that can greatly benefit your usage of this project. To install Python 3.10.xx, you can visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

Please note that while this project does support Python version 3.11.x, we do not recommend its use due to potential performance issues. Some features might not be fully optimized or compatible with Python 3.11.x We are actively working to address these issues and plan to provide better support for Python 3.11.x and other versions in the future.

Staying up to date with the latest releases of Python is advised for the most secure and optimized development experience.
